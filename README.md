# Agentic AI Experiment

Welcome to the Agentic AI Experiment repository!  
This space is dedicated to exploring the capabilities of Agentic AI‚Äîsystems that exhibit autonomy, adaptability, and intelligent decision-making in complex environments.

The first project in this repository is the **MCP On-Call Assistant**, originally developed for the Caseware Hackathon 2025.
